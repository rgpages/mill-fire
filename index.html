			<p>About 100 firefighters from seven agencies were dispatched to fight the fire, which prompted officials to briefly declare an evacuation within a one-mile radius of the plant at 1651 South F St.</p>
			<p>The evacuation notice was rescinded about 7 p.m. Firefighters continued their watch overnight.</p>
			<p>The blaze, which was reported shortly after 4:30 p.m., sent an ominous plume of black smoke high into the hot summer air that area residents could see for miles. Dozens of people lined South A Street to capture the first hour of the fiery scene on their smartphones and cameras as traffic on the thoroughfare slowed to a crawl. Police officers temporarily blocked side streets near the mill.</p>

			<p>Employees at the scene when the fire broke out said they raced to safety as the fast-moving fire began consuming the mill within minutes. No injuries of employees or firefighters were reported. More than 100 people were believed to be working at the mill at the time the fire started,</p>
			<p>Dewayne Hunter, 40, a forklift driver at the mill, said he was in the finish yard when a large dryer, used to dry wet veneer, caught fire and then ignited debris in the air.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;The fire was, like, right there in my face,&rdquo; he said.</p>

			<p>It was difficult for Hunter and other employees not to speculate about what the fire means for them and their families.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;All the buildings are down, and it&rsquo;s still burning,&rdquo; said Melody Fairbanks, who has worked at the mill for 20 years, shortly after getting out of the plant. &ldquo;This is the worst possible thing that could happen to me.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>Firefighters were hampered by the absence of any fire hydrants south of railroad tracks next to the mill, Eugene Springfield Fire Chief Randy Groves said.</p>
			<p>Firefighters relied on water tenders and a Weyer&shy;haeuser water-dumping helicopter called in by the state Department of Forestry to help battle the flames.</p>

			<p>The fire spread to two other buildings in the mill complex but those were quickly stamped out, Groves said.</p>
			<p>A number of spot fires ignited in wildlands to the south of the mill. Firefighters were on the scene with a water line in case any hot spots reignited.</p>

			<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m hoping we have a handle on this now,&rdquo; Groves said about 8 p.m., &ldquo;but we&rsquo;re not going anywhere any time soon.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>Groves said ready water would not have saved the mill, but might have prevented the fire from spreading into the wildlands.</p>
			<p>Firefighters were aided by a lack of strong winds that Groves said could have spread the fire farther and kept the smoke closer to the ground.</p>
			<p>The cause of the fire officially remains under investigation. Groves said it could be days before investigators can determine the cause. No damage loss figure was available immediately.</p>
			<p>Groves said boilers and propane tanks exploded in the fire. Some workers at the scene said they believe that glue tanks also may have exploded. Glues are used in making plywood and veneers.</p>
			<p>Groves praised the company and its employees for their orderly evacuation. &ldquo;They were well organized,&rdquo; he said.</p>

			<p>The 33-acre mill is owned by privately held Swanson Group Mfg. LLC, based in Glendale. It is one of the family-owned business&rsquo; four wood products mills in Oregon.</p>
			<p>The complex consisted of about 200,000 square feet of buildings.</p>
			<p>The mill sits to the south of a rail line, which was closed temporarily Thursday. Immediately north of the line is the city of Springfield&rsquo;s public works maintenance headquarters. Immediately to the south of the mill is the Knife River gravel mine.</p>

			<p>Among the onlookers on South A Street was Cliff Moore, 56, of Springfield, who said he was driving down Main Street when he first saw the smoke from around 28th Street. He said that in a town the size of Springfield, most everyone knows someone who works at the mill.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t see this every day, and it&rsquo;s hard to believe you&rsquo;re seeing it,&rdquo; he said with his camera aimed at the fiery scene.</p>
			<p>Employees were left in a state of disbelief. About 6 p.m., some employees boarded a Lane Transit District bus that ferried them back to the mill&rsquo;s parking lot so that they could drive their vehicles home.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Obviously, we&rsquo;re not going to have a job to come back to on Monday,&rdquo; Hunter said.</p>
