			<p>Christian Montes remembers the smell of something burning. Then he saw a huge plume of black smoke billow up to the second floor of the Springfield Plywood and Veneer mill, where he and dozens of others were at work Thursday afternoon.</p>
			<p>Hundreds of lives would change in the minutes to come.</p>
			<p>“I saw the roof light up. Everyone was already in a panic to try to get out,” Montes said Friday morning, as he huddled with other workers in a gravel parking lot just yards away from the mill’s charred remains. “All I remember is coming outside and watching the whole thing burn down.”</p>
			<p>None of the roughly 250 employees were hurt in the fire that ripped through the Springfield plant. But the mood outside on Friday was a mixture of disbelief and resignation that their next paychecks had vanished along with the mill.</p>
			<p>“Half the people have been working there for 10-plus years,” said David Buenroustro, who worked at Springfield Plywood and Venner about two years. “They dedicated their lives to that building.”</p>
			<p>Workers from their early-20s to mid-60s said it was still too soon to know what they would do. Some who gathered in the mill’s parking lot said they would try to find work at other mills run by the Swanson Group, in Roseburg, about 80 miles south on Interstate 5, or Glendale, 140 miles south.</p>

			<p>Others wanted to stay closer to home.</p>
			<p>“I was 14 days away from retiring,” said Bill Cushman, a 61-year-old utility worker in the mill who’s worked there since 2002.</p>
			<p>“Everyone makes right around $3,000 to $4,000 a month,” he said. “Now you’re going to take that out of the local economy. That’s going to hurt.”</p>
			<p>The mill’s employees typically earned about $15 an hour, plus benefits, workers said, and they were raking in the overtime as demand for plywood increased in the last couple of years.</p>
			<p>“This is the morning after,” plant manager Mike Martin said. “We don’t have a lot of answers. We’re just trying to sort things out.”</p>
			<p>“Obviously, folks are in shock,” he added. “Our main concern is taking care of our folks and getting them some answers.”</p>
			<p>Martin and several employees set up tents, chairs and snacks in the large gravel lot in front of the mill at 161 South F Street to comfort the arriving employees.</p>

			<p>There were hugs. There were stories. There was silence as they contemplated a shaky future.</p>
			<p>Many will likely file for unemployment insurance while seeking other work.</p>
			<p>Francisco Mascote, 63, left work at 3:30 p.m. Thursday, an hour before the fire erupted. A press operator for 17 years, he could see the cloud of smoke from his home. He’s not sure what will come next.</p>
			<p>“I’ll just look for another job,” Mascote said.</p>
			<p>The workers are eligible for unemployment insurance through the state. Checks are typically sent out weekly, and are based on an employee’s average wage over the last five fiscal quarters, Worksource Lane Assistant Manager Julie Davidson said.</p>
			<p>“We are currently in contact with the employer to discuss any and all services that they would like for us to provide,” she said. “We have offered multiple options,” including meeting with workers face-to-face.</p>
			<p>Davidson said several mill workers had already come to the Worksource Lane office by then.</p>
			<p>Employees said company officials planned to meet with them Monday afternoon.</p>
			<p>Friday morning, a slow stream of cars trickled past security guards into the gravel parking lot at the burned veneer mill. Some workers were getting rides to pick up their vehicles, which they’d been forced to leave behind as workers were rapidly evacuated Thursday.</p>
			<p>“All my tools are in there,” said Daniel Grimes, a two-year employee at the mill, as he pointed toward the smoking wreckage. “I had two tool kits. My laptop was in there. I lost thousands.”</p>

			<p>For Gene Henderson, Thursday’s fire was like a sickening case of deja vu. He’d come to Springfield Plywood and Veneer in 2012, after the Corvallis mill he worked for also burned down.</p>
			<p>Holding the hand of his 9-year-old daughter, Lori, Henderson could barely believe the tangled mass of wood and steel in front of him.</p>
			<p>“The most important thing is everyone is safe,” he said. “But this is devastating.” Still, Henderson managed to stay upbeat, confident he could find another mill job somewhere else in the state,</p>
			<p>Tom DeHaven, 60, isn’t so sure he’ll be as fortunate. A ripsaw operator, DeHaven was scheduled to have surgery for carpal tunnel syndrome in his right wrist in the coming weeks. The fate of his health insurance is up in the air now.</p>
			<p>He left the mill just 30 minutes before the fire started.</p>
			<p>Then, he says, “I got a call from my grandson. He said, ‘Your mill is burning down.’ I hurried back as fast as I could. I couldn’t believe it. It made me sick.”</p>
			<p>DeHaven has worked in mills since the early 1970s, and has seen several fires, “But not like this.” He said he plans to file for unemployment insurance.</p>
			<p>“It’s been a good company to work for. It’s been real steady,” he said. But, “When a job stops, a mortgage payment and everything else doesn’t. ... When you get to my age, finding another job is going to be really tough.”</p>
			<p>Many workers wonder whether they’ll find another employer as fair as Swanson.</p>
			<p>“I’m really nervous right now,” admitted William Suchanek, 34, watching the smoke with other employees. “I don’t know what I’m going to do.”</p>
			<p>Suchanek, a forklift operator who had been with the company for 18 months, said he had found his “dream job,” one he had wanted to stay on with.</p>
			<p>The mill was hot and the hours long, but Suchanek and other employees said they enjoyed working at the mill and the company treated them fairly. Jeremy Larsen, 35, another forklift operator, said he was hired six months ago after fighting wildfires for eight years. Larsen said his prior job wasn’t bringing in enough income to support his wife and two-year-old son, but it now offered a fallback option for him.</p>
			<p>“Depending on what happens, I might go back to fighting wildfires for the summer,” he said.</p>
			<p>Josh Moore, a 39-year-old press operator who had worked at the mill four years, had called in sick Thursday due to heat exhaustion. He watched the smoke from his backyard near the mill and then evacuated his wife and two children to his parents’ home in the Thurston area.</p>
			<p>Moore said he’s girding to seek a new job but his outlook remains positive.</p>
			<p>“Everything happens for a reason,” he said. “I’m a firm believer in my life, and in the past when bad things happen there’s always a reason for it. I usually end up in a better spot for it.”</p>
